Just select "Start Game" to play the original Uncivilized Charadesâ„¢ game.    It's dirty enough to enterntain and create a lot of laughs, has good variety as well.  For the rest of you sick bastards out there, select toggle on the "Dirty Birds Only"  version which has no g-rated clues, and a few words/phrases included that were just too raunchy to keep in the original.  

"Let's Keep It Clean" version also available so little Suzie doesn't leave the party asking her Dad what a dildo is.  

The rest you'll pick it up, but read on if you want to be the Game Nazi.  

Game is played using 2 teams.  
Teams will alternate turns.  
Each player will be allotted 2 minutes to act out, while their team guesses. 
Person acting out may make noises (vroom, orgasms sounds, etc.) but may not speak words to out right give it away. Player selects "Got It" if their team guesses the clue within the time allotted.  Once time expires, other team get's chance to steal points being played for.  Other team may take a second to congregate, and submit one guess.  Submission of their guess is not timed but should be within reason.  You may skip a secret word/phrase provided up to 2 times per turn but each time your point availability will be reduced 1 point.  If you play the first clue your team can earn all 3 points, if guess right, and before time expires.  If you choose to skip then you may toggle between the clues but only 2 points will be played for, likewise if you opt to see a 3rd clue you can choose between all of them but only 1 point will be played for and you're a f'cking pansy.  Whatever points are played for the other team will be optioned with stealing them in the event the time expires.  Score to win is defaulted to 20 but you can toggle that in the start menu.
